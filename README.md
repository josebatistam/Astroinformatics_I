# Astroinformatics_I - Graded Practices

This repository serves as a centralized collection point for all graded practices submitted as part of the Astroinformatics I course (Semester 1, 2025) at Universidad de Antofagasta. It aims to maintain a well-organized and version-controlled record of all assignments.

## Repository Structure

The repository's layout is designed for clarity and maintainability:

* The **root directory** contains this main `README.md` file and acts as the entry point for the entire collection of practices.
* **Individual graded practices** are organized within their own dedicated subdirectories, named `/Practice_1/`, `/Practice_2/`, `/Practice_3/`, and `/Practice_4/`.
* Each practice subdirectory typically follows a consistent internal structure, containing:
    * `/codes/`: Houses shell scripts (`.sh`) and Python scripts (`.py`) relevant to the practice's tasks.
    * `/latex/`: Contains the main LaTeX file for the practice (e.g., `Practice_X.tex`), along with auxiliary files generated during compilation (`.aux`, `.log`, `.out`, etc.).
    * Specific directories like `/csv/`, `/fits/`, `/lc/`, `/lightcurves/`, `/lists/`, and `/plots/`: These are used for input data (such as `.csv` or `.fits` files), processed light curve files (`.lc`), generated plots (`.pdf`), or intermediate lists, depending on the requirements of each particular practice.
    * `Practice_X_Instructions.pdf`: The original problem statement or instructions for the specific practice.
    * `Practice_X.pdf`: The compiled PDF solution for the practice.

## Important Notes

Please be aware that the local course directory was restructured during the development of these practices for improved navigation and file access. As a result, all the scripts (`.sh` and `.py`) and LaTeX files located in the `/Practice_X/` subdirectory have been updated to reflect these changes to prevent compilation errors. However, for transparency, any code presented directly within the LaTeX files in the submitted solutions has **not** been updated to reflect the modified scripts. This preserves the original practice solutions as they were initially developed and submitted.
